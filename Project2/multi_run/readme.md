Let's do another battle MAG vs OPENAI and let's see who is a best go programmer this time

Soo let's start doing 100000 run and see who is better

MAG 59.2539218s
AI  hahah ez, OPENAI launch a deadlock on noleggiati sometimes, too easy that time maybe I can ask him to remove this and redo evrything

After a rapid rewriting AI beat me doing 55.5938895s

Now It's my turn again
