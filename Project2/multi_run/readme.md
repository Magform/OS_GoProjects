# Testing

## Frist test
In the first test I'll execute both codes 10000000 times in series and I'm going to visualize the total execution time, the total client number is 10 and there are 3 different types of vehicles

### Results

AI      -> 15m23.826416742s
Mine    -> 15m8.330674915s
Mine V2 -> 15m6.966791227s

### Conclusions
All three versions of the code, being very similar, have very similar execution times. However, after running the test multiple times, it appears that the code written by the AI has a slightly higher average but lower variance compared to both of my versions. To confirm this, more tests and longer executions would be needed.

## Second test
In the second test I'll execute both codes 2000 times in series and I'm going to visualize the total execution time, the total client number is 100000 and there are 3 different types of vehicles

### Results

AI      -> 7m15.658817963s
Mine    -> 7m16.240213866s
Mine V2 -> 7m5.542896673s

## Third test
In the third test I'll execute both codes 10000 times in series and I'm going to visualize the total execution time, the total client number is 1000 and there are 10000 different types of vehicles

### Results

AI      -> 4m56.635597401s
Mine    -> 5m54.655375947s
Mine V2 -> 5m11.838512948s

### Conclusions

In this test, we observe that the code generated by the AI has a significantly faster execution time compared to Version 1 of my code and quite faster than V2. 
However, I haven't been able to understand the reason for this. I would expect my V2 to be faster, followed by the AI code with a slightly higher speed than my V1, but not by much.
