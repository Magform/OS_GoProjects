## Testing
Now I want to do some tests to see if my code or the one generated by an AI (in particular by chatgpt) is faster


### Frist test
In the first test I'll execute both codes 1000000 times in series and I'm going to visualize the total execution time, the total client number is 10 and there are 3 different types of vehicles

#### Results

AI      -> Deadlock
AI V2   -> 
Mine    -> 

#### Conclusions
