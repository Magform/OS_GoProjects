## Testing
Now I want to do some tests to see if my code or the one generated by an AI (in particular by chatgpt) is faster, to do this i'm running <code>go run [file] > [out] </code> and watch the last line with <code> tail [out]</code>


### Frist test
In the first test I'll execute both codes 10000000 times in series and I'm going to visualize the total execution time, the string is always the same, that is: "aaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbcccccddddccccccffff" and we're going to look for the character "c"
#### Results

AI      -> 15m51.397097981s
Mine    -> 8m54.27409867s
Mine V2 -> 7m53.184600876s
Mine V3 -> 7m17.118914719s

### Second test

Now I try to run the code 10000 times with a random string of 100000 characters generated each time and always look for the letter "c"

#### Results

AI      -> 13m32.995996718s
Mine    -> 19m5.086632872s
Mine V2 -> 18m25.519745637s
Mine V3 -> 4m16.07750622s

#### Conclusion
My code is slower, I need to improve it, maybe I can try using mutexes (this is V2).
Speed has improved but not that much, maybe I can launch multiple different instances of "check" that act on a different "repetitions" variable so that it behaves as if I have multiple concurrent accesses to the variable; this would likely provide increased speed but greatly reduce the readability and maintainability of the code. I'm still going to do this just to see if I can beat the AI (this is V3).

### Third test

For the last test I run the code only 100 times but with a random string of 10000000 characters

#### Results

AI      -> 21m47.054311037s
Mine    -> 17m26.153838886s
Mine V2 -> 17m10.924859735s
Mine V3 -> 3m37.370729103s

### Final comment

I only managed to beat the AI by using a trick that doesn't actually make the execution faster. I simply identified that the bottleneck was due to the innumerable simultaneous accesses to the "repetitions" variable so I went to create more, in my case 3, but hypothetically I could use one per letter to get the maximum speed but, for now, I am satisfied with this.
Another thing we can notice is how the code is much faster in processing very long strings rather than in processing many strings, this is precisely due to the fact that V3 can write string data in 3 different variables. 

### Another code
I had another idea so I try to implement this that is a sort of variant code V3 pretty better (using an array instead of multiple variable)
