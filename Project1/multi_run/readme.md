## Testing
Now I want to do some tests to see if my code or the one generated by an AI (in particular by chatgpt) is faster

### Frist test
In the first test I'll execute both codes 1000000 times in series and I'm going to visualize the total execution time, the string is always the same, that is: "aaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbcccccddddccccccffff" and we're going to look for the character "c"
#### Results

AI -> 1m35.22821051s
Mine -> 52.783684107s

For now my code seems to have increased speed, and not by a little. 

Now Im tring to do the test 100000 time with random string of length of 10000 and always looking for letter "c"

AI take 1m27.555818s
Mine take 45.0553586s


I know that probably my code is shit but at least is fast as fuck

Third test now 1000 times with string of lenght 100000





PS. I could have removed screen printing but since it also does that part of delivery and the two implementations aren't quite the same I decided to leave it
