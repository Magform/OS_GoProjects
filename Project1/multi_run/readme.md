The main scope of this file is to run the two script 100000 times and see which is faster

(Maybe I can remove the writing since both wirte same thing but since AI write a little more detail i want to beat it)


With always same data
AI, on my machine, do 41.0782406s
Mine, on my machine, took 32.1174086s
That is a lot better

Now Im tring to do the test 10000 time with random string of length of 10000 and always looking for letter "c"

AI take 1m27.555818s
Mine take 45.0553586s


I know that probably my code is shit but at least is fast as fuck
