## Testing
Now I want to do some tests to see if my code or the one generated by an AI (in particular by chatgpt) is faster


### Frist test
In the first test I'll execute both codes 1000000 times in series and I'm going to visualize the total execution time, the string is always the same, that is: "aaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbcccccddddccccccffff" and we're going to look for the character "c"
#### Results

AI      -> 1m35.249918511s
Mine    -> 52.783684107s
Mine V2 -> 51.757870603s

### Second test

Now I try to run the code 10000 times with a random string of 10000 characters generated each time and always look for the letter "c"

#### Results

AI take 1m12.70360255s
Mine take 1m55.538962265s

#### Conclusion
My code is slower, i need to improve it, maybe I can launch multiple different instances of "check" that act on a different "repetitions" variable so it act like I have multiple simultaneous accesses to the variable; this would likely provide increased speed but greatly decrease the readability and maintainability of the code.
Or maybe I can try using mutex (this is the actual V2)

### Third test

For the last test I run the code only 1000 times but with a random string of 100000 characters

#### Results

AI -> 1m19.027777264s
Mine -> 1m54.305495528s



PS. I could have removed screen printing but since it also does that part of delivery and the two implementations aren't quite the same I decided to leave it
